# Strong Adversarial Attacks Are Characterized by Large Loss Landscape Curvatures

This repository contains research and implementation code exploring the relationship between adversarial robustness and loss landscape geometry, specifically investigating how strong adversarial attacks are characterized by large loss landscape curvatures.

## Overview

This project investigates the connection between adversarial vulnerability and the curvature of the loss landscape. The core hypothesis is that strong adversarial attacks exploit regions of high curvature in the loss landscape, providing insights into why certain adversarial examples are particularly effective.

## Key Concepts

- **Loss Landscape Curvature**: Measures the second-order geometry of the loss function around data points
- **Adversarial Robustness**: The model's ability to maintain correct predictions under adversarial perturbations
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Perturbations designed to fool neural networks into making incorrect predictions
- **Loss Landscape Geometry**: The topological and geometric properties of the neural network's loss function
